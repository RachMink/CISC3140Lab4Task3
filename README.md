# CISC3140Lab4Task3
web page that shows dynamically rendered content

## Introduction

As I used the ‘suggested’ method for complete beginners I used the school Linux Machine. I created an
HTML page and JS file under my ~/public_html/ folder that requests the data from my backend URL - my API from section 4.2 and display its text on the webpage. 

The URL to my complete frontend and backend webpage is http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~rminkowi/index.html


## URL route
`http://`
The first part of the URL is the scheme, which indicates the protocol that the browser must use to request the resouce 
This website's scheme is HTTP (unsecure).

`acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu`
Next follows the authority, which includes the domain name and port (separated with a colon)
The domain indicates which Web server is being requested. Here the acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu is the web server being accessed. As this URL 
uses standard ports of HTTP the port is omitted. 

`/~rminkowi/index.html`
this is the path to the resource on the Web server. In this case it is the physical file location on the Web server where the file index.html 
is stored within the rminkowi folder.
